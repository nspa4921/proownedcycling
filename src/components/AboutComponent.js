                    <h2>It all started with one idea</h2>
                    <p>In 2015, Oscar Bj√∏rn-Rosager got a good idea. The idea was to offer Danish cycling exercisers and fans the cycling clothing that the professional cycling teams were no longer allowed to wear. He had been a part of cycling for several years and discovered that every year the pro teams were left with excess equipment and clothes that needed replacement due to new sponsors.</p>
                    <p>Together with the professional cycling industry, Oscar invented a solution that creates a more sustainable consumption and production pattern in modern cycling. Everyone interested could now get hold of the unique professional cycling clothing - without it costing a fortune. The first cycling clothing sold was from the professional cyclist, Casper Pedersen, who was also co-founder the first year. In addition to recycling the clothes, the sustainable idea has meant that the Danish company, together with the professional cycling teams, has saved the globe a water consumption of two million litres of water per year.</p>
